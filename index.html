  <p class="intro">Fall Out Boy is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001.
    The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which Wentz was heavily involved. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of their
    respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording their debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003).
   The album became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, as well as some moderate commercial success.</p>
